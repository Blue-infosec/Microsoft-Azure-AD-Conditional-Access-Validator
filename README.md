# Microsoft Azure Conditional Access Validator

Conditional Access policies, at their simplest, are if-then statements. If a user wants to access a resource, they must complete an action. Conditional Access contains many settings, and they can complement each other. Misconfiguration can take place when having multiple Conditional Access policies. I created a PowerShell script for companies to validate their Conditional Access configuration.
